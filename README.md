# 📊 Customer Analysis Dashboard using Tableau

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a customer sales analysis dashboard built from scratch using Tableau. It’s designed to help businesses quickly understand their customers, product performance, and regional trends — all in one place.

## 🔍 Problem

Businesses often collect a lot of sales and customer data but struggle to make sense of it. Without the right insights, it’s hard to answer questions like:
- Who are our top customers?
- Which regions and products perform best?
- Are discounts actually improving sales or cutting into profit?

## ✅ Solution

To solve this, I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau that brings together key customer and sales metrics. Some of the insights include:

- Sales and profit trends across different regions
- Customer breakdown by gender
- Top-performing product categories and sub-categories
- Impact of discounting on overall profit
- Time-based analysis for better forecasting

## 💡 Business Value

With this dashboard, a business can:
- Focus marketing efforts where the revenue is strongest
- Optimize discounts and pricing
- Understand product trends by gender or region
- Make smarter, faster, data-driven decisions

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – For data visualization
- **Microsoft Excel** – For initial data cleaning and prep
